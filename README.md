# Speciality-coffee-picker

This is where you can find your next coffee beans to try. I don't use API to get data about coffee, and used chatGTP to generate the database for me. In there, it contains about 50 kinds of coffee beans data, and you can find one for you from there. The data is limited, so it needs to be connected to other database to be more useful. However, the main purpose of buiding this app was to practice React form. In that thin, I am very happy about that, as I tried many kinds of new methods and different approaches. 

# The problem:
As I am new to react, I was confused about how to work with form in React. Even though, it doesn't so anything, except findding suitable coffee beans for a user ( no submit to database to store those data), it was challenge for me to use useState/ useEffect to store information, and make it working correctly. Moreover, I wanted to try out Typscript, as I learnt basic of Typescript recenly, and it was also a huge challenge to work with. I am not still confortable working with Typescript at all, so I need more and more practice. On the other hand, I was able to make myself working with React more confidently after trying out  new things and experimenting React features. 

I think this is the final version as this is my practice App. However, if I find a interesting api that has a good source for coffee beans or when I learn to build my own api, I will build a similar app with better functionality, for sure.
